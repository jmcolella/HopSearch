== HopSearch

An app that allows users to search for various hop varietals to learn more about their attributes.

Users can:

* favorite hops they like

* comment on hops to give tips, suggestions or notes

* update any incorrect or missing information for any hop

HopSearch utilizes the BreweryDB API for a majority of the hop information, but also builds upon that information with user generated data. This feature was added due to the incompleteness of the BreweryDB API in regards to hops.
